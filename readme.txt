Java Space Alert Mission Generator
==================================

Download executable: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9102471/JSpaceAlertMissionGenerator.jar


Right, now the generator is quite basic: Start it from the command line and it will output a mission profile.
It will also play the mission if you provide MP3 files in a directory called "clips" in the same directory where you execute the jar.


In order to play the MP3 clips, you need to download a set of MP3 files and save them in "clips".
Look at http://sites.google.com/site/boardgametools/SpaceAlertMissionGenerator.
German and English Sound sets are included in the the Space Alert Mission Generator.
You can also look into the forums on http://www.boardgamegeek.com/ which provide some language files for Japanese and so on.

Have fun!

Planed additions:

- Background alert sounds (like on CD)
- configuration options
- GUI...
